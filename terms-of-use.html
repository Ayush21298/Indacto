                Terms of Use
            </div>
            <div class="introduction">
                <p>These terms and conditions of use (“Terms of Use”) along with other policies available on our platform forms a legally binding agreement between You and Indacto (“Indacto”, “Our”, “We”, “Us”), an App which is owned and operated by KTC Digitools Private Limited with its R/o at 5-A/113 NIT Faridabad, Haryana, India-121001 (hereinafter referred to as “Company”)</p>
                <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – and you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Indacto.</p>
                <p>With respect to Indacto’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Indacto accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>
                <p>PLEASE ENSURE THAT YOU READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY BEFORE REGISTERING ON OR/AND USING THE INDACTO APP. CONTACT US IN CASE YOU HAVE ANY QUERIES OR DOUBTS REGARDING OUR TERMS. </p>
                <p>If You do not agree with any part of these Terms of Use or/and Privacy Policy, kindly refrain from using Our services on the Platform.</p>
                <p>Any changes to these Terms of Use will be posted on this page wherever appropriate. The Users must visit this page periodically for updates on the Terms of Use applicable to their use of the Platform. Any Users’ continued usage of the Platform after any such update, change, replacement or modification in the Agreement constitutes their valid consent to such changes.</p>
                <p>Indacto is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>
                <p>Indacto is an App available at AppStore and PlayStore helps its users restore their Whatsapp data (chats, media and documents) in case the user is switching from Android phone to iOS phone or vice-versa. We use iCloud (in case of restoring from iOS device) or Google Drive (in case of restoring from Android device) to access the users' already backed up Whatsapp data on their drive and download it in their new device. If at any time the User does not accept or agree to any terms of this Agreement, on a continuing basis in relation to any of the Services offered on the Platform, they should not access the Platform.</p>
                <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Indacto will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Indacto  cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left and the same causes any type of Data loss or other issues.</p>
                <p>Indacto reserves the right to periodically review, update, change or replace any part of these Terms of Use or other terms of the Agreement as it may consider appropriate at its sole and absolute discretion.</p>                
                <p>The User must note that while the user is getting his/her WhatsApp data restored through Indacto, we will forcefully close his/her WhatsApp application running on the phone and the User will not be allowed to use the WhatsApp application on that phone till the restoration process is completed. The process might fail in the event that: <br>
                    •  There was no backup found corresponding to that WhatsApp number of the user’s Drive <br>
                    •  Device disconnected from Internet <br>
                    •  Device switched off <br>
                    •  Application Closed <br>
                    •  Device Memory full <br>
                </p>
                <p>We shall not be liable if the process fails because of the above mentioned reasons. </p>
